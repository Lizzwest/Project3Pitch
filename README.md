### Project Overview
##### (Include project idea/concept, project name, who owns git master repo on github, team name [if desired], team member roles, elevator pitch)
Project Idea:  An app that hosts all of SEI 713 games in one spot.

Project Name: GArcade

Team Name: TBD

Git Master: Lizz
React Master(Leading in React): Barent
MongoDB Master(Leading our database): Cabassa
Express Master(Leading in express): Martin

Elevator Pitch: Who doesn't love to play games? And who doesn't love to support their fellow classmates work? What if we took the two and combined them into one concept? Enter: GArcade. A hub, if you will, to host all our fellow cohort mates Project One games, all in one spot. As a user, you will have the ability to create an account, log in, create a list of favorite games in your profile, remove games that you don't play anymore and be able to see which games others love as well. A description of the game, a still image, and some info about the developer will all be included, all in one spot: the GArcade. So, do you want to play a game?(Or two...Or three...)
