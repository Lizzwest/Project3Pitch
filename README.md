## Fork & Clone this repo.

Review the [Project 3 requirements](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/sei-ga-sea/11-projects/project-3#project-feedback-evaluation) and check out some [examples](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/sei-ga-sea/11-projects/past-projects/project3).

Provide information in the following sections:

----------------------------------------------------------
### Project Overview
##### (Include project idea/concept, project name, who owns git master repo on github, team name [if desired], team member roles, elevator pitch)
Project Idea:  An app that can host all of SEI 713's Project One games in one spot.
</br>
</br>
Project Name: GArcade
</br>
</br>
Team Name: Big Money Rustlas
</br>
</br>
Git Master: Lizz</br>
</br>
React Master(Leading in React): Barent</br>
</br>
MongoDB Master(Leading our database): Cabassa</br>
</br>
Express Master(Leading in express): Martin
</br>
</br>
Elevator Pitch: Who doesn't love to play games? And who doesn't love to support their fellow classmates work? What if we took the two and combined them into one concept? Enter: GArcade. A hub, if you will, to host all our fellow cohort mates Project One games, all in one spot. As a user, you will have the ability to create an account, log in, create a list of favorite games in your profile, remove games that you don't play anymore and be able to see which games others love as well. A description of the game, a still image, and some info about the developer will all be included, all in one spot: the GArcade. So, do you want to play a game?(Or two...Or three...)

### Additional Technologies
##### (MERN Stack expected [MongoDB, Express, React, Node], include any external APIs)
React Iframe
Cloudinary(maybe for stretch)

----------------------------------------------------------
### Work Allocation
##### Who is your Gitmaster? Who will be doing what? 
Git Master: Lizz- Responsible for all things git. Organize sprints and zoom meetings, project management/ time management, Auth issues, floater( will hop in to all aspects as needed).
React Master(Leading in React): Barent- Responsible for React. Basic structuring of react side and allocation as needed to team for support.
MongoDB Master(Leading our database): Cabassa- Responsible for database structure and functionality. Owning backend and allocating any tests or issues as needed.
Express Master(Leading in express): Martin- Responsible for all things express, routing and basic functionality of app, as well as allocating work as needed.

----------------------------------------------------------
### Daily Sprints
##### (or otherwise general plan for accomplishing tasks, preferably broken down by day)

#### Our sprints are broken up as every two days, will discuss with team if we can break them down further, but planned on tackling day by day using the 2 day sprint plan.

Sprint One- Set up front and back end repos, stub out all basic routes, created database, and have all components (incomplete) rendering at their routes. At the end of sprint one, Git master should have code in the master branch that DOES something(and does it correctly)

Sprint Two- Functionality. Have games imported into our Hub, basic styling so we know exact layout of app, and tests to db functional. By the end of Sprint Two, GIt master should have a full skeleton of the working app code, and should have all been tested and approved.

Sprint Three- Final functionality for app. All routes should be working properly, database should be receiving and storing information accurately (and hashing all pw) and we should be working on styling and any stretch goals that can be implemented in time. If app is not fully functional, push any stretch goals and everyone tackles debugging. Git master should have ALL code by this time and have it all functional(or being debugged as a team).

Sprint Four (?)- Styling. All styling, as well as any stretch goals that can be FULLY implemented with MINIMAL debugging potential. No more new code after lunch on Thursday. (Unless its new code to replace broken code, but we should not be adding anything to the project at this point). Git master should have Final Product fully pushed, pulled and stored on the master branch by Thursday night.
